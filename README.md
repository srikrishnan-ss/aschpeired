## From rain input, overlandflow, scouring to debris flows 
## Mass conservative, no complete momentum conservation.  
## Infinite slope model
## Apparent friction angle 
## Flexible timestep based on CFL condition.
## Erosion like Hungr
## Recalculating density and concentration 
## At certain concentration from manning to Bingahm  
## Vegatation Scouring in Root
## Initial moisture content, percolation, saturation, saturation exceeded runoff
